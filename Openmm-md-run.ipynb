    "[OpenMM](https://openmm.org/) is a powerful Python-focussed package for molecular dynamics simulations. Click on the link to learn lots about it, but for the present purposes the key learning objective is to become aware of a rather diferent approach to running MD simulations than using the more 'old-fashioned' (but still very widely used and very powerful) command-line focussed tools like **AMBER** and **GROMACS** for example.\n",
